### Prerequisites

### Usage

Now that you have installed the necessary dependencies using Yarn, you can run the React Todo App locally.

1. Start the development server:

   ```

   This command will start the development server, and your app should be accessible at [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) in your web browser.
